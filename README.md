## Hi. Hallo. Hola. Salam. I'm Sohail Jannessari and...this is under construction.

Data Analyst & Political Scientist with a multidisciplinary background in quantitative methods, international politics, and journalism. I specialize in making political and social data understandable and actionableâ€”whether in the classroom, in policy analysis, or for broader audiences through writing and media.

I am currently trying to change track, moving from writing and teaching, to the "real" world. This is not so much a new venue, rather than a sort of a return â€” Back to the Future or something. I finished a Data Science course at TechLabs Dusseldorf a couple of months ago, and am now undertaking their Deep Learning track.

I'm also attending an intensive German course in MÃ¶nchengladbach at the moment, hoping to reach B2 by the end of 2025, so...KEIN STRESS!
